This tool Forse to shutdown victims PC or Mobile by increasing Zip files.

[+] Uses : python2 ZipP3r.py Levels Output.zip

** It aspects 1 to 10 levels.

What it is basically is a huge file with dummy data compressed to many levels to generate a very small compressed file. For example in a test run, this script of mine generates a compressed file of size **30.58 KB** which when decompressed is actually **10000000000 GB**. This is done to drain out a computerâ€™s memory until it shuts down.
